# Release Notes for Office Insiders

This article contains release notes for Insider builds of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, and Project for Windows desktop. Every week, we’ll highlight interesting new features, important fixes, and any significant issues we want you to know about. Note that we often roll out features (and sometimes even fixes) to Insiders over a period of time. This allows us to ensure that things are working smoothly before releasing the feature to a wider audience. So, if you don’t see something described below, don't worry you'll get it eventually.
