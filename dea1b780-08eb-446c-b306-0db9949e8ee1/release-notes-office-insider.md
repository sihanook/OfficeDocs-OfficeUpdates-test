## What's New:

### Morph Transition Enhancements - Morph by Name

Specify the shapes you want to morph

#### Getting Started:

- To get Morph to treat two objects as the same object, the user can rename the shapes using the Selection Pane.
- The name must be prefaced with “!!” (two exclamation points) for Morph to use it to override our default matching behavior, e.g. “!!Name”
- Users can continue to rename shapes with any name that doesn’t start with “!!” without worrying that it will change the way Morph works

#### Scenarios to Try:

- Insert a Shape in a slide, let's say Rectangle
- Create a new slide
- Insert a different shape in the 2nd slide, let's say Triangle
- Open SelectionPane, rename the Rectangle in slide 1 to "!!shape", and rename the Triangle in slide 2 to "!!shape"
- Apply Morph on the 2nd slide
