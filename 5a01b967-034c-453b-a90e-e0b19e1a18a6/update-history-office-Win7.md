# Update history for Office 365 ProPlus on Windows 7 

 > [!NOTE]
>
>- Support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020. [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-windows-7-support?rtc=1)
>- Office 365 ProPlus is no longer supported on Windows 7 but will continue to get security updates until January 2023. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/windows-7-support)
>- If you’re a home user running Office on Windows 7, see [Windows 7 end of support and Office.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/windows-7-end-of-support-and-office-78f20fab-b57b-44d7-8368-06a8493f3cb9?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US)
Version 2002 is the last version of Office 365 ProPlus that will be available for devices running Windows 7 after Windows 7 goes out of support in January 2020.  

Version 2002 is expected to be available in the following channels:
- Monthly Channel in late February 2020
- Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) in March 2020
- Semi-Annual Channel in July 2020

Versions on Semi-Annual Channel are usually available for only 14 months, but we're making an exception just for Version 2002 to align with how long Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Windows 7 are available.

This extended availability for Version 2002 also applies to other update channels, such as Monthly and Semi-Annual (Targeted), but only applies to devices running Windows 7.
