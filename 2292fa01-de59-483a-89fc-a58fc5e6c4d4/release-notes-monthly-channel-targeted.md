# Release Notes for Office Insiders

This article contains release notes for Insider builds of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, and Project for Windows desktop. Every week, we’ll highlight interesting new features, important fixes, and any significant issues we want you to know about. Note that we often roll out features (and sometimes even fixes) to Insiders over a period of time. This allows us to ensure that things are working smoothly before releasing the feature to a wider audience. So, if you don’t see something described below, don't worry you'll get it eventually.

The admin can require a specific prefix and suffix be added to the name for a group when it's created, and can block specific words from being used. This helps minimize the use of inappropriate words in group names as well as IT manage the representation of groups in their directory. Naming Policy also helps organizations that deploy team sites to categorize them based on department.
