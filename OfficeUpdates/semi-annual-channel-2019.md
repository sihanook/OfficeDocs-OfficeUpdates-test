### Non-security updates
### Excel

- <div>Resolved an issue that prevented Hyperlinks from being pasted in some protected sheets.</div>


### WinProj

- <div>Consider the following scenario:</div><ul><li>You open a project.</li><li>You click the File menu, click Export and click the<b> Create PDF/XPS</b> button.</li><li>Within the Browse dialog box, you enter a file name and click OK.</li></ul><div>In this situation, you find that the PDF of XPS file is not created.</div>


### Word

- <div><span>We fix an issue where&nbsp;<span style="display:inline !important;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);">JAWS on Windows 19H1 builds won't announce words when using Caps + Right arrow.</span></span></div>


### Office Suite

- <div>For Office files synced by the OneDrive Sync Engine, document metadata such as Require Properties and Content Type requirements are no longer validated upon Save and Save As. This results in two improvements: First, users can now move documents between SharePoint libraries without having to define document metadata where the destination library does not require it, which more closely follows the behavior of Office files synced by OneDrive. And second, a Save As operation to the local OneDrive folder can now be done without any network roundtrips resulting in a significant performance improvement in the Office apps.</div>


- <div>Fixed an issue where &quot;Fix my account&quot; notification does not disappear after signing-in successfully.</div>

### Word: Feature updates
- **AutoSave for cloud files is now enabled by default:** This change means users won’t have to worry about losing their changes in documents stored on OneDrive or SharePoint Online. Changes will be saved in the cloud automatically, and users will no longer have to explicitly press Ctrl + S or the Save button. However, they will have to understand this change in behavior so they don’t make accidental changes to presentations. Note that users can turn off AutoSave using the AutoSave toggle at the top of the screen. We recommend that you notify your users about this upcoming change and educate them about how to best take advantage of this new feature in Office 365.
