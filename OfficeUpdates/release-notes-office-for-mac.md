# Release notes for Office for Mac

 
Office for Mac that comes with an Office 365 subscription is updated on a regular basis to provide new features, security updates, and non-security updates.
  
Updates are available from Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU). To use Microsoft AutoUpdate, start an Office application, such as Word, and then choose **Help** > **Check for Updates**. If you're an admin and want to update the computers in your organization with your existing software deployment tools, you can download and deploy the update packages for each application.

  
> [!NOTE]
> - For a list of all Office for Mac releases, Update packages and additional download links, see [Update history for Office for Mac](update-history-office-for-mac.md). 
> - If you're an Office Insider, see [Release notes for Insider Fast builds](https://support.office.com/article/b3260859-2c1e-4f12-92a4-62a6997efb3a).
> - Starting with the 16.17 release in September 2018, these release notes also apply to Office 2019 for Mac, which is a version of Office for Mac that’s available as a one-time purchase from a retail store or through a volume licensing agreement. But, some features listed in the release notes are only available if you have an Office 365 subscription.
> - The release notes for version 16.16 and earlier also apply to Office 2016 for Mac, which is also a version of Office for Mac that’s available as a one-time purchase. Older versions up to and including 16.16 can be activated with an Office 2016 for Mac volume license. You can’t activate version 16.17 or later with an Office 2016 for Mac volume license. For information about Office 2016 for Mac releases from September onward, see [Release notes for Office 2016 for Mac](release-notes-office-2016-mac.md).
> > 
> - We often roll out features (and sometimes even fixes) to Monthly channel over a period of time. This allows us to ensure that things are working smoothly before releasing the feature to a wider audience. So, if you don’t see something described below, don't worry you'll get it eventually.
