# Release Notes for Office Monthly Channel (Targeted)

This article contains release notes for Insider builds of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, and Project for Windows desktop. Every week, we’ll highlight interesting new features, important fixes, and any significant issues we want you to know about. Note that we often roll out features (and sometimes even fixes) to Insiders over a period of time. This allows us to ensure that things are working smoothly before releasing the feature to a wider audience. So, if you don’t see something described below, don't worry you'll get it eventually.  

> [!NOTE]
> - Release notes are posted weekly and may be a compilation of multiple builds
> - The release notes publication date may not match the actual build release date
> - Microsoft Teams on existing installations of Office 365 ProPlus - Beginning in late June, Microsoft Teams will be included in existing installations of Office 365 ProPlus (and Office 365 Business) upon updates of these installations. The date when Teams will be added depends on which update channel you're using. Please refer to [Deploy Microsoft Teams with Office 365 ProPlus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/teams-install) for additional information.
