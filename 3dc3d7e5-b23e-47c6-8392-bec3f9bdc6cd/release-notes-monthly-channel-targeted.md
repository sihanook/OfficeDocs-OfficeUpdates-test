# Release Notes for Office Insiders

This article contains release notes for Insider builds of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, and Project for Windows desktop. Every week, we’ll highlight interesting new features, important fixes, and any significant issues we want you to know about. Note that we often roll out features (and sometimes even fixes) to Insiders over a period of time. This allows us to ensure that things are working smoothly before releasing the feature to a wider audience. So, if you don’t see something described below, don't worry you'll get it eventually.

### Feature updates
### Access

- **Keep up with the times! The Date/Time Extended data type has better precision.:** Introducing a new and improved data type  

To enhance syntax compatibility with SQL, and to increase accuracy and level of detail in records that include dates and times, we’re implementing the DateTime2 data type into Access. This additional date & time data type will include a larger date range (0001-01-01 through 9999-12-31), with higher-specified time precision (nanoseconds, rather than seconds) that you will be able to provide and perform calculations on. To enable, select New field > Date & Time Extended. [Learn more](https://support.office.com/article/708c32da-a052-4cc2-9850-9851042e0024)
