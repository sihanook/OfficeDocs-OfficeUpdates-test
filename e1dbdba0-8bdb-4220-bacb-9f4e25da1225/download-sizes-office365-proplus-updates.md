# Download sizes for updates to Office 365 ProPlus

The following tables show, by release date and update channel, the approximate download size when updating from a previous release of Office 365 ProPlus to the most current release.
  
We're providing this information in advance of the actual release date to help enterprise customers plan network bandwidth utilization for these upcoming channel updates. Because we're providing this information in advance, some information might change by the time the actual release comes out.
  
Our goal is to provide update size information a week in advance of a release, but there are times when the information isn't available that far in advance. Releases for Semi-Annual Channel and Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) are scheduled for the second Tuesday of each month. Monthly Channel releases are not on a set schedule.

For information about features, security updates, and non-security updates that are included in a given release, see [Release information for updates to Office 365 ProPlus](release-notes-office365-proplus.md).

 
> [!NOTE]
> - The approximate download size listed in the tables only applies to the en-us x64 version of Office 365 ProPlus. (All releases prior to March 13, 2019 show x86 sizes.)
> - Download sizes are approximate. Actual download sizes might vary, possibly by as much as 50 mb. 
> - Release dates and build numbers that are italicized and enclosed in "\< \>" are subject to change. 
> - Only the releases from the last four months are listed.
> - Only the most recent previous releases are listed in the tables. If you're updating from an older release, your download size will be larger.
> - If you're switching to a different channel, for example from Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) to Semi-Annual Channel, your update size will be considerably larger than what's listed in the table. It could entail a full download, which would be at least 1 GB.
